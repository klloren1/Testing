This is a project to develop a dice game that will be programmed in java.

The game:

2 Players.

Each player has 5 rolls per round consisting of 2 dice each. 

If you roll doubles, ten points are added to your score. 

You can choose to lock in any dice you roll.

Locked dice values are added directly to your score. 

Only a maximum of 5 dice may be locked each round and once locked they cannot be exchanged. 

The winner is the player with the higher score after three rounds.
